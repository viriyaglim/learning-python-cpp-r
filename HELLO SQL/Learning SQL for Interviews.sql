# ðŸ“Š SQL for Quant Interview Prep â€” 20 Essential Queries

SQL is heavily tested in quant interviews for data handling, joins, and time-series prep.  
Here are 20 must-know queries (with finance-style examples).  

---

## 1. Basic Queries
```sql
-- Select specific columns
SELECT ticker, price FROM stocks;

-- Filter with conditions
SELECT * FROM trades WHERE volume > 100000;

-- Sorting results
SELECT * FROM prices ORDER BY date DESC;

-- Limit results
SELECT * FROM prices ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Distinct values
SELECT DISTINCT ticker FROM trades;
```
## 2. Aggregate Functions
```sql
-- Count rows
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM trades WHERE ticker='AAPL';

-- Average / sum
SELECT ticker, AVG(price) AS avg_price 
FROM prices 
GROUP BY ticker;

-- Group by with multiple metrics
SELECT ticker, AVG(volume), MAX(price), MIN(price)
FROM trades
GROUP BY ticker;

-- Filter groups (HAVING)
SELECT ticker, AVG(price) 
FROM prices 
GROUP BY ticker
HAVING AVG(price) > 100;

-- Date-based grouping
SELECT DATE(time) AS trade_day, SUM(volume)
FROM trades
GROUP BY trade_day;
```

## 3. Joins
```sql
-- Inner Join
SELECT p.date, p.ticker, p.price, f.pe_ratio
FROM prices p
JOIN fundamentals f
  ON p.ticker = f.ticker;

-- Left Join
SELECT p.date, p.ticker, f.dividend_yield
FROM prices p
LEFT JOIN fundamentals f
  ON p.ticker = f.ticker;

-- Self Join (lag returns example)
SELECT a.ticker, a.date, a.price AS today_price, b.price AS yesterday_price
FROM prices a
JOIN prices b
  ON a.ticker = b.ticker AND a.date = b.date + 1;

-- Join multiple tables
SELECT t.ticker, t.date, t.volume, p.price
FROM trades t
JOIN prices p ON t.ticker = p.ticker AND t.date = p.date
JOIN fundamentals f ON t.ticker = f.ticker;
```

## 4. Window Functions 
```sql
-- Running total
SELECT date, ticker, 
       SUM(volume) OVER (PARTITION BY ticker ORDER BY date) AS cum_volume
FROM trades;

-- Moving average
SELECT date, ticker, 
       AVG(price) OVER (PARTITION BY ticker ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 4 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS ma5
FROM prices;

-- Ranking
SELECT ticker, date, price,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY date ORDER BY price DESC) AS rank_on_day
FROM prices;

-- Lag/Lead (returns)
SELECT ticker, date, price,
       LAG(price, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY ticker ORDER BY date) AS prev_price
FROM prices;

-- Percentile rank
SELECT ticker, date, price,
       PERCENT_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY date ORDER BY price) AS pct_rank
FROM prices;
```

## 5. Advanced Techniques
```sql
-- Subquery (max price for TSLA)
SELECT * FROM prices
WHERE price = (SELECT MAX(price) FROM prices WHERE ticker='TSLA');

-- CTE (Common Table Expression) for daily returns
WITH daily_returns AS (
  SELECT ticker, date,
         price / LAG(price) OVER (PARTITION BY ticker ORDER BY date) - 1 AS ret
  FROM prices
)
SELECT ticker, AVG(ret) AS avg_return
FROM daily_returns
GROUP BY ticker;

-- Pivot (monthly returns)
SELECT ticker,
       SUM(CASE WHEN MONTH(date) = 1 THEN ret ELSE 0 END) AS Jan,
       SUM(CASE WHEN MONTH(date) = 2 THEN ret ELSE 0 END) AS Feb,
       SUM(CASE WHEN MONTH(date) = 3 THEN ret ELSE 0 END) AS Mar
FROM daily_returns
GROUP BY ticker;    
```
