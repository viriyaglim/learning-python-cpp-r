List comprehensions

Day 5–6: Data Structures

Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries

Indexing, slicing, iteration

Day 7: Functions & Modules

Defining functions, parameters, return values

Lambda functions, importing libraries

✅ Mini-Project: Write a program to simulate rolling dice, flipping coins, and basic probability experiments.

Week 2 – Intermediate Python & Data Handling

Goal: Work with data like a quant.

Day 8–9: File Handling

Week 3 – Advanced Python & Quant Tools

Goal: Transition to quantitative finance applications.

Day 15–16: Object-Oriented Programming

Classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation

Magic methods (__init__, __str__, etc.)

Day 17–18: Error Handling + Testing

Try/except, raising errors

Unit testing with pytest

Day 19–20: Advanced Libraries

SciPy (optimization, integration)

Statsmodels (regression, hypothesis testing)

Day 21: Time Series & Simulation

Random walks, Monte Carlo simulation
