# learning-python-cpp-r 🧠🧮
My learning repo for **C++**, **Python**, and **R**
Focus: disciplined practice, clean code, reproducible research, and market-minded problem solving.

---

## 📦 Structure
- 📂 `cpp/` — C++ snippets & exercises (modern C++17/20, CMake-ready)
- 🐍 `python/` — Python scripts/notebooks (data, backtesting, utilities)
- 📘 `r/` — R scripts & Quarto/Rmd (tidyverse, finance)
- 📒 `notebooks/` — Jupyter/Quarto notebooks (exploration, demos)
- 🗃️ `data/` — small sample datasets (kept lightweight)
- 📝 `docs/` — site content (for GitHub Pages)

---

## 🎯 Goals
- ✅ Daily deliberate practice & commits
- 🧩 Clean, minimal examples per concept
- ⚙️ Automated checks via **GitHub Actions**
- 📈 Finance-aware exercises (backtests, risk, stats)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start
1. Add a tiny “hello world” in each language:
   - `cpp/hello.cpp` → prints a line
   - `python/hello.py` → prints a line
   - `r/hello.R` → prints a line
2. Commit & push → confirm CI runs (green checks).

> Tip: Keep examples atomic—one idea per file. Small, composable, testable.

---

## 🧰 Tooling
- Editors: **VS Code** / **RStudio**
- CI: GitHub Actions (build C++, run Python & R)
- Style: simple `.gitignore`, clear folder boundaries

---

## 🧭 Roadmap
- [ ] Add unit tests (Pytest, Catch2, testthat)
- [ ] Wire CMake for `cpp/` and a sample lib
- [ ] Quarto report in `docs/` → enable Pages
- [ ] Starter backtest (SMA crossover) in `python/`
